## <a name="scripts"></a>NPM scripts

There are 3 main scripts to speed up work:

- `build`: builds a project in the` build` folder based on files from the `src` and` public` folders,
- `start`: observes changes in the` src` folder and starts working preview,
- `test`: starting the unit tests,
- `refactor`: the script automatically formats files in the `src/` folder according to the accepted code formatting convention, and also checks for errors using ESLint.

<br/>


## <a name="githooks"></a>GIT hooks
The project uses Git Hooks - the ability to run scripts in response to selected Git events.

Each time you execute the `git commit` command, unit tests, formatting, and linting will be run
for files selected with `git add` and to be saved in commit.
